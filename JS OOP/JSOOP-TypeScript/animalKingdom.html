    <p>See the console for the result of the testing code.</p>
    <p>This isn't one of the projects I'm most proud about as far as high-quality code but I have no time to fix all the things I don't like about it.</p>
    <p>The OOP is also not the best as far as coupling, cohesion, etc. but that's what I managed to do in a hurry.</p>

        I think all the requirements in the assignment are covered. There are:
        <ul>
            <li>2 out of 2 required modules (Interfaces, ForestObjects)</li>
            <li>7 out of 3 required interfaces (IMovable, IForestObject, IPlant, IAnimal, ICarnivore, IHerbivore, IOmnivore)</li>
            <li>7 out of 6 required classes (Forest, ForestObject, Plant, Animal, Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore)</li>
            <li>A lot more than the 2 required uses of inheritance</li>
            <li>A lot of methods (mostly overriding) out of 12 required</li>
            <li>2 out of one required generic use: in the Forest.ts file, forest and allObjects are arrays of T elements where T is IForestObject</li>
            <li>2 out of one required static use: one for a static variable (forest's size) and one for a static method (positionObjectsInForest(...): T[])</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
